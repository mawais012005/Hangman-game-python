# Hangman-game-python
Step 1: Setting Up the Game
Start by creating a Python file and making a list of words for the game. Use the random module to pick a random word from this list. Set up variables to keep track of the game: an empty list for guessed letters, a counter for remaining lives (usually 6-8), and a hidden version of the word with underscores (_) for unguessed letters.

Step 2: The Main Game Loop
Create a loop that keeps running until the player either wins or loses. In each round:

Show the current state of the game: remaining lives, guessed letters, and the partially revealed word.
Display ASCII art of the hangman to show progress.
Ask the player to guess a letter using input().
Step 3: Checking Player Input
Make sure the player enters only one valid letter that hasnâ€™t been guessed before. Convert the input to lowercase and validate it. If the input is invalid (e.g., not a letter or already guessed), show an error message and skip to the next round without penalizing the player.

Step 4: Handling the Guess
Check if the guessed letter is in the target word:

If correct: Update the hidden word by replacing underscores with the guessed letter wherever it appears.
If incorrect: Reduce the remaining lives by one and add the letter to the list of guessed letters.
Update the display to reflect any changes.
Step 5: Winning or Losing
After each guess, check:

If all letters in the word are revealed, the player wins. End the game and congratulate them.
If the player runs out of lives, they lose. Reveal the word and end the game with a message.
Display the final result and the full word, whether the player wins or loses.
Step 6: Adding Hangman Art
Create a list of multi-line strings to represent the stages of the hangman (e.g., scaffold, head, body, arms, legs). Show the appropriate stage after each incorrect guess to visually indicate how many lives are left.

Ideas to Make the Game Better
Add difficulty levels by adjusting word length or the number of lives.
Group words into categories like animals, countries, or movies.
Introduce a scoring system based on how many lives are left at the end.
Use the colorama library to add colors for better visuals.
Build a graphical version using libraries like pygame or turtle.
Useful Functions
Use random.choice() to pick a random word.
Use string manipulation to update the hidden word.
Use lower() and isalpha() to validate player input.
Use conditionals to handle game logic.
Use loops to keep the game running smoothly.
This setup creates a fun, interactive text-based game that helps teach important programming skills like loops, conditionals, string handling, and user input. You can also expand it with extra features like saving high scores or adding more complex gameplay elements.
